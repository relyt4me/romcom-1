## RomCom Mod 1 Paired Project
## Contributors
This project is a collaboration between Chadrick Dikerson https://github.com/chad-dickerson, Tyler Haglund https://github.com/relyt4me, and Scott Ertmer https://github.com/sertmer.
## Objectives
I this project we plan to write clean, DRY JavaScript to store our data; use a provided class by creating object instances using the `new` keyword; manipulate the page after it has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM; Develop an understanding of event bubbling and use event delegation on dynamic elements; and begin to understand how to write effective, clean HTML & CSS.
## Overview
People say that romance novels are formulaic. Well ... maybe that's true. We're going to make an app that generates romance novel covers!
